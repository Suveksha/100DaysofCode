Solved using the Summation method:

Let n^{th} term of the series 1 + (1 + 2) + (1 + 2 + 3) + (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)â€¦(1 + 2 + 3 +..n) be denoted as an

Sum of n terms= Summation of Sum of natural numbers
Therefore sum of natural numbers= n(n+1)/n
now Summation of n(n+1)/n can be written as Summation of (n^2 +n)/2
Sum of square of natural numbers=n(n+1)(2n+1)/6
Therefore simplifiying the equation by substituting the values will give us the eq. n^3+3n^2+2n/6.

This gives the sum of the series.
